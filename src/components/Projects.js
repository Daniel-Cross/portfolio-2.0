								The King Kev Quote Generator idea was manifested one day while searching for a certain
								quote from everybody's favourite 1970's footballer, Kevin Keegan. King Kev has a habit
								of saying some things that don't make sense to anyone but himself, he also happens to be
								incredibly unlucky, often when he's minding his own business or when he tries to do
								something good for someone else. Upon unsuccessfully finding a collated collection of
								Keggy's antics, the King Kev Quote Generator was born! It returns 50+ quotes/incidents
								from the great man himself at random. The website got National coverage in the UK when a
								footballing podcast gave the website a mention on a show!

							This is the completed technical test received from BookingGo (RentalCars) which helped gain
							successful employment with the company. The task was to implement a user story as close to
							the original example as possible. The solution had to work in all modern browsers (IE10+) in
							desktop only, however, consideration was made for a mobile first approach.
							<br />
							<br />
							The search function had to return a city from the BookingGo api with matching characters
							once three or more letters were entered into the search input. Thorough testing and test
							driven development were also used but not mandatory.

							Real pets are great, but they do have drawbacks. They smell. Your mum might be allergic to

							<br />
							To solve these problems, I built my own JavaScript pet instead. JavaScript pets are great.
							Because they're made of JavaScript, they can do literally anything, and they don't have any
							of the drawbacks of regular pets.
							<br />
							<br />
							This pet has all the following features: <br />
							They can get older <br />
							As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit <br />
							You can walk your pet to increase it's fitness. üèÉ<br />
							You can feed your pet to decrease it's hunger. üçï <br /> You can talk to your pet to see if
							it needs feeding or walking <br /> If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE üíÄ{' '}
							<br /> If your pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE üò¢
